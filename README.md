# `sylvia-template`

This is a project template for use with the [_Sylvia framework_](https://github.com/CosmWasm/sylvia).

## Generating a project scaffold

### Prerequisites

You need `cargo-generate` installed on your system.

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
```

### Usage

```sh
cargo generate CosmWasm/sylvia-template
```

Or, to provide the name of the project non-interactively:

```sh
cargo generate CosmWasm/sylvia-template -n my-contract
```


## Developer's guide

Sylvia main goal is to make the creating of contracts as free of the boilerplate code as possible. Many mechanisms are hidden behind a few procedural macros, so that developers can focus on writing the contract's bussiness logic. A good starting point to familiarize with the tool is a [Sylvia book](https://cosmwasm.github.io/sylvia-book/).

Other than that this template repository provides user with a useful example contract and scripts that helps during the development process.


#### Cargo scripts

Cargo scripts can be run without any additional tools other than cargo itself. They are a useful aliases for the more complex commands:
 * `cargo wasm` - builds the Wasm release binary,
 * `cargo wasm-debug` - builds the Wasm debug binary for testing purpuses,
 * `cargo schema` - generates json schema of the contract's messages. 

#### Check the Webassembly binary

Once the Webassembly binary is generated it is worth to additionally check it's correctess using a cargo tool named [coswasm-check](https://crates.io/crates/cosmwasm-check). There's a short user's guide available in crates.io repository.

#### Using contract as dependency to other contract

The contracts generated by sylvia can be also used as part of other contracts. For this reason there's a feature flag provided in this repository called `library`. It prevents sylvia from generating entry points for the contract, so that it can be used as a dependency. Without that feature, using contract in some other crate can cause a collision with the main contract's entry points. More info is available in the Sylvia Book.
